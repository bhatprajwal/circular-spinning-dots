# Circular Spinning Dots Component with Timer
Circular Spinning Dots Component with Timer using HTML, CSS and Javascript:

This interactive feature improves user interaction by adding a visually dynamic loading overlay. It features a spinner made up of spinning rings and dots. The colors of both elements correspond to shades of the VIBGYOR spectrum (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red). Each ring and dot rotates independently, as well as together around a central point, creating a layered and engaging animation.

## This spinning animation features
- **Colorful Design:** The dots and rings rotate in a bright rainbow color pattern (VIBGYOR)
- **Animated Motion:** Individual rings rotate around their dots, while the entire circle of dots and rings also rotates smoothly
- **Countdown Timer:** A timer (which can be customized) is displayed below the spinner
- **Overlay Effect:** A semi-transparent background can be used to indicate when something is loading in a web application

This web component is ideal for any web applications requiring an interactive and colorful loading screen or waiting indicator

Happy Coding!!
